Professional Experience
=======================

__Deka R&D Corp.__ *Technical Staff* February 2008-Present (Manchester, NH)

Developed FDA Class III medical device software. Project domains included
electro-mechanical, fluid management, and computer vision

+ Developed augmented vision system using OpenGL ES 2 and GLSL using MIPI camera
+ Refined the software process as the first developer to release a C++
  subsystem for project in a team of 20+ developers. Designed and configured
  subsystem CI servers
+ Implemented emergency power handling in C on TI MSP430 
+ Earned *Evolved Thinker* award for role in board bring-up. Developed Python
  based hardware verification, validation, calibration and debugging
  architecture, bypassing application software to directly control FPGA and
  NI-DAQ based measurement/control. Provided on-the-fly Qt based GUI control of
  I/O. Implemented test specifications, and logs/reports for pass/fail testing

__DRS Codem Systems, Inc.__ *Software Engineer* Mar. 2000-Oct. 2007 (Merrimack, NH)

Performed complete life-cycle development of servo control software for the
Flexible Antenna Controller products

+ Reduced on-site integration times for prototypes a month to a few days in most cases
+ Introduced version control and automated build scrips to the department

__Lockheed Martin, OR&SS__ *Associate Software Engineer* Feb. 1999-Mar. 2000 (Liverpool, NY)

Designed, coded, tested and integrated software for the fire control component
of the AN/SQQ-89 Anti-Submarine Warfare Combat System. Programmed in C and
Ada95 on an HP-UX 11.0

+ Implemented safety-critical state machine logic for SEI Level 5 program

__Raytheon Electronic Systems__ *Software Engineer I* Aug. 1997-Feb. 1999 (Bedford, MA)

Theater High Altitude Area Defense / Theater Missile Defense software

+ Maintained and documented test & calibration user interface
