(1.) I have been an embedded software and feedback controls engineer for nearly
two decades. During that time I have delivered an abundance of complex technical
solutions for innovative products. (2.) I empower my teams to make better
decisions through superior tools and methodologies. (3.) What I am looking for
now is a role where I can achieve maximum autonomy, mentor young engineers, and
help people by delivering new and innovative technologies.

## What are your strengths?

### Knowledge Based

I deliver complex working software with irrefutable proof of verification and
validation. Design repeatable processes and make compelling data-driven
business narratives supporting technical decisions.

I can keep the entire product execution scheme in my head from requirements and
planning to specification and execution. (Need Example)

### Transferable

I empower teams to make better decisions through the introduction of superior
tools and methodologies. Examples: Introduction of Version Control, Transition
from MS-DOS to GNU/Linux, IPython Notebooks for analysis, Developing models,
OpenModelica, Behavior Driven Development

I am a relentless learner

### Personal

I am loyal to a fault, and stay with teams for years. I take care of my team and
worry about the individuals in them.

## What are your weaknesses?

I will tell authority figures what I think they want to hear when pressured
face-to-face, and my communication can shut down when I am struggling. I am
working on being more prepared for answering tough questions in person and
standing up for myself and my team under adversity.

## Why do you want this job?

I don't know enough about this job, yet. As I understand, it is your task to
sell it to me.
