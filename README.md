Professional Experience
=======================

__Deka Research & Development Corp.__ (Manchester, NH)

*Technical Staff*: February 2008-Present

Performed complete life cycle development for medical device software including
FDA Class III. Project domains included complex electro-mechanical, fluid
management, and computer vision

+ Developed augmented vision system using OpenGL ES 2 and GLSL using live
  textures from MIPI CSI-2 camera sensor
+ Mentored 4 junior developers
+ Refined the software process as the first developer to release a C++
  subsystem for project in a team of 20+ developers. Designed and configured
  subsystem CI servers
+ Implemented emergency power handling in C on TI MSP430 
+ Earned *Evolved Thinker* award for role in board bring-up for project
+ Developed Python based hardware verification, validation, calibration and
  debugging architecture, bypassing application software to directly control
  FPGA and NI-DAQ based measurement/control. Architecture provided on-the-fly
  Qt based GUI for control of all I/O points. Robot Framework provided front
  end to implement test specifications, and output logs/reports for pass/fail
  testing
